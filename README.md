# What is Kothonva?
***Kothonva is based on Python, and our approved compilers are limited to Python or C/C++. Kothonva is a lightweight language that is simple and easy to use, and the syntax retains most of Python's original functions, but also adds a large number of new functions.***

## Features of Kothonva:
* [x] **Ability to run directly with Py**
* [x] **Fast running speed and compilation speed**
* [x] **Lightweight, small footprint or memory**
* [x] **The syntax is concise and clear**
* [x] **(Obsolete)It is used more like a language than a superset**

# Installation method
* **Just because it's a Python project doesn't mean it's downloadable with the pip command!**
  * **You should use git or download and apply the main.py file globally**
    * **The following installation method will not work:**
    ```
    pip install Kothonva #one
    git clone https://github.com/Buelie/Kothonva #two
    ```
    * **Why doesn't it work?**
      * **1.The first one, because we didn't upload Kothonva to Pypi(Because the author encountered an error when uploading, it cannot be deleted, and it will be supported in the future, of course, you can also upload instead of the author, maybe the author will directly approve it)**
      * **Second, because our repository contains all the Kothonva versions(The author's hard drive storage is not enough, woo-woo)**
