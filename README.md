# Installation method
* **Just because it's a Python project doesn't mean it's downloadable with the pip command!**
  * **You should use git or download and apply the main.py file globally**
    * **The following installation method will not work:**
    ```
    pip install Kothonva #one
    git clone https://github.com/Buelie/Kothonva #two
    ```
    * **Why doesn't it work?**
      * **1.The first one, because we didn't upload Kothonva to Pypi**
      * **Second, because our repository contains all the Kothonva versions**
